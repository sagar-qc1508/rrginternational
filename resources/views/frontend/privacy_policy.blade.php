                    <p>It is RRG International's policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. This Privacy Policy applies to www.rrginternational.com (hereinafter, "us", "we", or "www.rrginternational.com"). We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide us through the Website. We have adopted this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") to explain what information may be collected on our Website, how we use this information, and under what circumstances we may disclose the information to third parties.

                    <h2>Website Visitors</h2>
                    <p>Like most website operators, RRG International collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. RRG International's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how RRG International's visitors use its website. From time to time, RRG International may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
                    <p>RRG International also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on http://www.rrginternational.com blog posts. RRG International only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below.</p>

                    <h2>Security</h2> 
                    <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to us, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>
